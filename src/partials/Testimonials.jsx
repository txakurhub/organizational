                â€” I am a full-stack developer from Argentina, specialized in
                creating visually appealing and functional content both working
                in a team and individually. My passion for technology and web
                development led me to graduate from a full-stack coding bootcamp
                a year ago and I am focused on continuing to develop my career
                in the tech industry. I am an empathetic, enthusiastic and
                proactive person, with an assertive communication style and
                always looking to learn new things. I am currently working on
                interesting projects and developing my skills to reach my full
                potential. If you are interested in collaborating or just
                chatting, feel free to contact me below.
